# Information about this Unit
{:.no_toc}

This unit is is part of three B modules offered in Q4 of the Hydraulic and Offshore Structures (HOS) track in the Civil Engineering MSc program at TU Delft:
- <a href="https://studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=63755" target="_blank">CIEM4210 Marine Renewables</a>
- <a href="https://studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=63756" target="_blank">CIEM4220 Dams, Dikes and Breakwaters</a>
- <a href="https://studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=63757" target="_blank">CIEM4230 Floating and Submerged Structures</a>

Most importantly, we are going to do some very fun things with probability!

Do them.

### Workshops

Easier if you do the homework.

### ADK Book

We will use the textbook *Structural and System Reliability* for the component and system reliability part of the course:

> Der Kiureghian, A. (2022). Structural and System Reliability. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. doi:10.1017/9781108991889

<!-- @book{der kiureghian_2022, place={Cambridge}, title={Structural and System Reliability}, DOI={10.1017/9781108991889}, publisher={Cambridge University Press}, author={Der Kiureghian, Armen}, year={2022}} -->

A description of the book can be found at the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108991889" target="_blank">book website</a>; note that all the other links on this web page will take you to <a href="https://www-cambridge-org.tudelft.idm.oclc.org/highereducation/books/structural-and-system-reliability/7B7F299239AD41812A0C3E2E93B3CA57#overview" target="_blank">this website</a>, which gives access to the online book and reader, but requires a TU Delft login, as it is offered through the TU Delft Library. In addition, there are a few hard copies on reserve in the TU Delft library, and Robert also has a few copies that he might be able to let you look at while in his office.

<!-- You can only read the texbook online if you are connected to the TU Delft wifi or using a VPN (use the eduVPN software if you are off campus). You can confirm you have access by checking if a green "Access" button appears at the top of the <a href="https://www-cambridge-org.tudelft.idm.oclc.org/highereducation/books/structural-and-system-reliability/7B7F299239AD41812A0C3E2E93B3CA57#overview" target="_blank">book website</a> and a "Read online" button is visible below the book description. -->

Once clicking "Read online" you can continue with "read only access" (registering for an account does not seem to provide any worthwhile reading benefits). 
> 
> The online textbook loads **very** slowly. It works by loading each chapter one at a time, and sometimes it takes several minutes per chapter. This is obviously annoying, but we have not found a way around it yet. The best strategy is to click on the Chapter you need and wait patiently for it to load. Once it is there, you can view all the contents in that chapter, either by scrolling up and down, or clicking the section links in the Table of Contents. For the required reading listed in the calendar, we will place links to the required chapter to make this process a bit easier (but unfortunately you will still have to wait for it to load). Please let Robert know if you find a better solution! 
> 
> Most links on this website will refer to specific chapters and reading in the textbook; once logged in with your TUD account, you should be able to open these links to the chapters directly. If the link does not work, try starting at the main book page and navigating to the necessary chapter using the Table of Contents (and let Robert know about the broken link!). 

For CIE42X0 we will rely most on the following chapters:  
- <a href="https://ereader.cambridge.org/wr/viewer.html#book/b465a335-deca-4553-b09f-8989cf136370/doc10" target="_blank">Chapter 3: Multivariate Distributions</a> 
- <a href="https://ereader.cambridge.org/wr/viewer.html#book/b465a335-deca-4553-b09f-8989cf136370/doc11" target="_blank">Chapter 4: Formulation of Structural Reliability</a>  
- <a href="https://ereader.cambridge.org/wr/viewer.html#book/b465a335-deca-4553-b09f-8989cf136370/doc13" target="_blank">Chapter 6: The First-Order Reliability Method</a>  
- <a href="https://ereader.cambridge.org/wr/viewer.html#book/b465a335-deca-4553-b09f-8989cf136370/doc15/pos_15.0" target="_blank">Chapter 8: System Reliability</a>  

<a href="https://ereader.cambridge.org/wr/viewer.html#book/b465a335-deca-4553-b09f-8989cf136370/doc9" target="_blank">Chapter 2</a> is pre-requisite material for our course, and can be skipped, but may be useful to refer back to as we go, especially to check the notation used throughout the textbook.

Although we will touch on a few topics from <a href="https://ereader.cambridge.org/wr/viewer.html#book/b465a335-deca-4553-b09f-8989cf136370/doc12" target="_blank">Chapter 5</a>, it is not the focus of this course. However, it gives an interesting perspective on a few other reliability methods that are widely used in practice (despite having some well-known issues), so this can be a very useful chapter to refer back to later, especially when trying to understand an unfamiliar reliability technique that may have been used by other engineers or researchers.

### Other Resources

This unit replaced a 1st-year MSc course CIE4130 Probabilistic Design in the old curriculum. The lecture notes (14MB) can be downloaded <a href="https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/acbbK9bZ2fAjOx1/download" attributes-list download>here</a>.  In particular, the chapters on structural reliability and system reliability may be interesting.

*Additional material will be added here and organized on an as-needed basis.*
