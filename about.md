## About

his unit is is part of three B modules offered in Q4 of the Hydraulic and Offshore Structures (HOS) track in the Civil Engineering MSc program at TU Delft:
- [CIEM4210 Marine Renewables](https://studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=63755)
- [CIEM4220 Dams, Dikes and Breakwaters](https://studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=63756)
- [CIEM4230 Floating and Submerged Structures](https://studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=63757)

We are going to do some very fun things with probability!

## Lecture

Super exciting. We will skip a few of them.

## Assignments

How are we actually grading these?
### Homework

Do them.

### Workshops

Easier if you do the homework.

### Projects

You will do stuff in other units.
## Resources

<!-- @book{der kiureghian_2022, place={Cambridge}, title={Structural and System Reliability}, DOI={10.1017/9781108991889}, publisher={Cambridge University Press}, author={Der Kiureghian, Armen}, year={2022}} -->

You can only read the texbook online if you are connected to the TU Delft wifi or using a VPN (use the eduVPN software if you are off campus). You can confirm you have access by checking if a green "Access" button appears at the top of [this website](https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108991889) and a "Read online" button is visible below the book description. Once clicking "Read online" you can continue with "read only access" (registering for an account does not seem to provide any worthwhile reading benefits).

{: .note }
The online textbook loads **very** slowly. It works by loading each chapter one at a time, and sometimes it takes several minutes per chapter. This is obviously annoying, but we have not found a way around it yet. The best strategy is to click on the Chapter you need and wait patiently for it to load. Once it is there, you can view all the contents in that chapter, either by scrolling up and down, or clicking the section links in the Table of Contents. For the required reading listed in the calendar, we will place links to the required chapter to make this process a bit easier (but unfortunately you will still have to wait for it to load). Please let Robert know if you find a better solution!

[Chapter 3: Multivariate Distributions](https://ereader.cambridge.org/wr/viewer.html#book/b465a335-deca-4553-b09f-8989cf136370/doc10)
[Chapter 4: Formulation of Structural Reliability](https://ereader.cambridge.org/wr/viewer.html#book/b465a335-deca-4553-b09f-8989cf136370/doc11)
[Chapter 6: The First-Order Reliability Method](https://ereader.cambridge.org/wr/viewer.html#book/b465a335-deca-4553-b09f-8989cf136370/doc13)
[Chapter 8: System Reliability](https://ereader.cambridge.org/wr/viewer.html#book/b465a335-deca-4553-b09f-8989cf136370/doc15/pos_15.0)

[Chapter 2](https://ereader.cambridge.org/wr/viewer.html#book/b465a335-deca-4553-b09f-8989cf136370/doc9) is pre-requisite material for our course, and can be skipped, but may be useful to refer back to as we go, especially to check the notation used throughout the textbook.

Although we will touch on a few topics from [Chapter 5](https://ereader.cambridge.org/wr/viewer.html#book/b465a335-deca-4553-b09f-8989cf136370/doc12), it is not the focus of this course. However, it gives an interesting perspective on a few other reliability methods that are widely used in practice (despite having some well-known issues), so this can be a very useful chapter to refer back to later, especially when trying to understand an unfamiliar reliability technique that may have been used by other engineers or researchers.
