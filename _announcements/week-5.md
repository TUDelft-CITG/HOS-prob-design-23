This is a reminder that you should finish HW 3 before class on Friday. To help you with this Benjamin (the TA) and will have a question hour on Wednesday from 15.00-16.30. I (Robert) will try to show up towards the end, but will also explain the assignment in class on Friday, before the workshop assignment. We are looking for a room for Wednesday, and will announce it when it is known. You can also send us questions about HW3 via email.

I know some of you are concerned with the amount of math in the Chapters 3.6 and 6: I don't expect you to be able to recite it all from memory, or perhaps even understand 100% of it. I want you to understand what the transformation to the standard normal space is and see how the gradient-based optimization method FORM works. This will help you interpret results of reliability analyses. My suggestion is to go through the reading once, then try HW3 and refer back to the text to build your understanding. If there are remaining questions send them via email and we will work through them at the question hour on Wednesday and in-class session Friday.
