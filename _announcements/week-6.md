The last two weeks of this unit will focus on system reliability. The reading listed for these two weeks is not that long. There are no practice problems for 8.6, but it is good to be aware of the bounding concept because it may be useful for you if in a situation when there are many elements, and to understand the role of dependence.

The contents of HW5 are simply: 1) review the MUDE book chapter [System Reliability](https://tudelft-citg.github.io/MUDE/reliability-system/overview.html), and 2) do problem 8.1 (parts 1 and 2 only!) in the ADK book. That's it!

In class on Friday we will take a real hydraulic system and schematize it using a simple graphical method for system reliability analysis: a fault tree.
