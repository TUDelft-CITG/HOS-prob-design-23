Workshop 5 is prepared and hosted by [Timo Schweckendiek](https://www.deltares.nl/expertise/onze-mensen/timo-schweckendiek) from Deltares. It is the second of two workshops on system reliability: after a brief introduction to event trees, a case study (a safety assessment of pipeline failure in dikes) will be introduced, after which you will work in groups. Files for completing the exercise will be posted to the course website <a href="https://tudelft-citg.github.io/HOS-prob-design/workshops/WS_05_assignment.html" target="_blank">here</a> at the beginning of class.
