We hope things are going smoothly with the reading and HW1 and HW2. Remember that there is no in-class session this week due to the holiday on Friday, but that you should finish both homework assignments before the first workshop on Friday of week 3. If you need to prioritize things, definitely focus on EVA (HW2), as that will be the main activity in the week 3 workshop.

Links to download the PDF slides for the 8 intro videos have been added to the HOS-PD-<a href="https://tudelft-citg.github.io/HOS-prob-design/PD/01_01_unit_intro.html" target="_blank">1.1</a>, <a href="https://tudelft-citg.github.io/HOS-prob-design/PD/01_02_rbd.html" target="_blank">1.2</a> and <a href="https://tudelft-citg.github.io/HOS-prob-design/PD/02_00_EVA.html" target="_blank">HOS-PD-2</a> (EVA) pages. The links for HW1 and HW2 in the calendar of this website have also been fixed.
